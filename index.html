      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>We are well-adjusted adults who think what really matters in life is making a trillion dollars and putting it
        in a big pile that we don't share with anyone. To that end, we started this little company that makes
        open-source software and gives it away for free.</p>
      <p>We are here to build software that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gets better and more useful with time (not just better at extracting money from users)</li>
        <li>Provides an intuitive, polished experience</li>
        <li>Is open source, so anyone can inspect and modify the code</li>
        <li>Does not collect user data</li>
        <li>Requests the minimum possible device and network permissions</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="mailto:contact723@ohmm-software.com">Email us</a> with any questions or ideas (this address is liable
        to change if we start getting spam, so check back here before sending). We'll eventually get around to setting
        up a donation link. In the meantime, contributions in the form of testing, feedback, and translations are
        welcome.</p>
